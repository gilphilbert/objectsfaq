        { "q": "What is Nutanix Objects", "a": "Nutanix Objects is an objects storage solution where data is stored as 'objects' rather than files on a file system.\n\nLike files, objects are considered _unstructured_ data and can be of any type including photos, logs, videos and pretty much anything else. Unlike traditional file systems, object storage is designed to allow applications to programatically access data, removing concepts designed for human interaction like files, file names, folders, etc.\n\nSince there are no files/filenames, when data is stored it's done so using an API. When storing data the platform, a \"PUT\" request that provides the data to be stored, a key (a unique identifier for this object) and, optionally, any metadata about the object are sent to the storage platform. To retrieve the data and/or metadata, a \"GET\" request can be made against the storage using the same key used to store the data.\n\nObjects are stored inside buckets, each of which can contain billions of objects. Buckets are usually used to separate different applications, data types, etc.", "category": "general" },
        { "q": "Why would customers want object storage", "a": "Great question! There are many reasons why customers would want to use object storage. Objects provide a programmatic way to access data which is perfect for developers, who really don't want to deal with infrastructure issues associated with filesystems. This makes object storage ideal for modern workloads.\n\nThe advanced features object storage provides (inluding WORM, Versioning, etc.) are unparalleled and provide safety and security against ransomware attacks and are ideal for backup and archive use-cases.", "category": "general" },
        { "q": "Isn't object storage really slow", "a": "It's true that object storage was origianlly developed for 'cheap and deep' storage requirements. This mean that density and cost-efficiency are paramount. However, access via APIs combined with the metadata storage and lookups makes object storage ideal for modern applications and an entirely new segment is opening. To play here, high performance is absolutely required and many of the 'traditional' objects vendors are struggling to move into this space. Nutanix Objects is built on AOS and offers very high performance.", "category": "general" },
        { "q": "How does Objects compare to Files", "a": "Files offers Network Attached Storage (NAS). There are many great use-cases for Files including home drive shares, rendering applications (think Pixar, etc.), video streaming and many, many more. File supports the NFS and SMB/CIFS protocols. Objects meets a different set of use-cases including modern applications (including storage for containers - think Kubernetes/Karbon), content repositories, multi-tiered analytics applications (Splunk SmartStore) and backup/archive use cases. Objects uses RESTful APIs, specifically the Amazon S3 API, the dominant standard for object storage. Both are solutions for unstructured data problems, but they tackle them in different ways.", "category": "general" },

        { "q": "When did Nutanix Objects GA", "a": "August 2019 (with AOS/PC 5.11)", "category": "sales" },
        { "q": "What are the use cases for Nutanix Objects", "a": "Objects fits into a wide range of solutions from core line-of-business applications (PACS, legal, cloud-native, Kubernetes, etc.) through multi-tier (Splunk SmartStore) all the way to backup and arhive (HYCU, Commvault, Veeam, Veritas Enterprise Vault). Essentially anything that can write data to S3. See more at [https://ntnx.tips/objects](https://ntnx.tips/objects)", "category": "sales" },
        { "q": "Which backup vendors does Nutanix Objects integrate with", "a": "Objects is certified with:\n* Commvault\n* HYCU\n* Veeam\n* Arcserve\n* Veritas NetBackup\n\nOther backup vendors that have Generic S3 support should work out of the box and can be certified", "category": "sales" },
        { "q": "How can I demo Nutanix Objects", "a": "[https://demo.nutanix.com](https://demo.nutanix.com) has a functional Objects demo. For a more in-depth demo, please check out our POC document at [https://ntnx.tips/objects](https://ntnx.tips/objects). Demos of Objects do not require licensing", "category": "sales" },
        { "q": "How do we qualify if a customer should go with Files or Objects? What are the key qualifying questions", "a": "* Find out what the customer’s application is and what protocol(s) it supports. If the application supports S3, the customer should leverage Objects. If the requirement is NFS/SMB, the customer should leverage Files.\n* If the workload or use case leverages S3 and generates or consumes massive amounts of data (PB-scale), typically Objects would be a good choice, as it is designed to handle these sorts of high-volume applications and workloads", "category": "sales" },

        { "q": "How is Nutanix Objects deployed", "a": "Nutanix Objects can be licensed either for use on an AOS cluster (\"Objects for AOS\") or for use on a dedicated cluster for Objects (\"Objects Dedicated\"). For smaller deployments (up to around 200TB), Objects for AOS can be a cost-effective way to add Object storage into a new or existing AOS cluster. For larger deployments, a dedicated cluster can be more cost effective", "category": "licensing" },
        { "q": "How is Objects licensed", "a": "Objects is licensed by usable TiB, the same model as is used for Nutanix Files. Objects licenses are aggregated at the Prism Central level and can be distributed around clusters within that Prism Central instance as desired, as long as the total amount of usable Objects capacity doesn't exceed the capacity licensed in Prism Central.\n\nLearn more at [https://ntnx.tips/objects](https://ntnx.tips/objects)", "category": "licensing" },

        { "q": "Is Prism Central required to enable Objects", "a": "Yes, Prism Central is required to enable Objects. Objects cannot be deployed from Prism Element", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "Which hypervisors are supported", "a": "Nutanix AHV and VMware ESXi are both supported", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "How far can Nutanix Objects scale", "a": "Nutanix Objects can scale to multiple-PB capacities and billions of objects by implementing multicluster scale out", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "What's the maximum number of nodes in a cluster", "a": "You can have up to 48 Objects nodes in a cluster", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "Is Objects supported on multiple clusters", "a": "Objects has the ability to use storage from multiple clusters to present a single Object service namespace within a datacenter. In other words, a single Objects store can span multiple clusters within the same physical location. The key benefit is capacity scalability of an Object Store instance, and enabling customers to deploy a large object store using spare (“landlocked”) capacity across their existing Nutanix deployments", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "Which protocols are supported by Nutanix Objects", "a": "Objects supports the Amazon Simple Storage Service API (S3 API)", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "Which S3 APIs are supported", "a": "Nutanix Objects supports the major S3 APIs that apply to the targeted use cases. These include:\n* GET\n* PUT\n* LIST\n* HEAD\n* DELETE", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "Can an application write with NFS or SMB/CIFS", "a": "For PACS apps that need WORM but want to write to a SMB/NFS target (i.e. can’t “speak S3”), the customer would need to go through Files to Objects tiering, which is on the Files roadmap for 1HCY21. Once files have been tiered to Objects, we can use our WORM constructs. Until then, we have partnerships with companies such as Ctera and Nasuni that can provide a NAS interface on top of Objects", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "Does Objects support tiering data", "a": "Tiering to another S3-compatible endpoint is available as of Objects 3.1", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "What are the hardware requirements for Nutanix Objects", "a": "Objects sizing primarily depends on performance requirements. In general, there are 3 nodes minimum needed for a clustered deployment. A single-node Object store can be deployed in point use-cases. Objects is designed to scale out, rather than up. So as an Object store grows in storage requirements and performance requirements, the cluster will scale out additional OVMs and Load Balancers to support the workload. You can roughly plan on 12 vCPUs and 36GB RAM per node, for OVM and LB", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "Does Nutanix Objects support AD or LDAP integration", "a": "The IAM service integrates with AD or LDAP to generate access keys for single users or multiple users in a group at once", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "What are the HA capabilities of Nutanix Objects", "a": "Nutanix Objects is deployed as a highly available solution, similar to Nutanix AOS. A Kubernetes cluster is deployed that provides the object store services in a containerized fashion. This provides Objects the ability to tolerate failure and handle upgrades without impacting the front end applications and users. Any data (say a bucket partition) that is stored in a cluster is always stored in a resilient manner so that its availability is maintained even during disk/node/block/rack failure within that cluster. With Replication, we will be able to store different bucket partitions in different clusters if there is such a need. E.g. if the same bucket is being accessed from multiple DCs by different applications, we will keep data belonging to these applications local to those applications (in the local DC) as much as possible", "category": "technical" },
        { "q": "Does the object replication feature also support multiple sites", "a": "Yes, multiple site support is on the roadmap and replication will be used to ensure site redundancy. There is the conventional S3 replication that can be configured and we are also looking at a user policy for desired site redundancy to handle the fault tolerance configuration automatically.", "category": "technical" }
